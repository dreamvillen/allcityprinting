Description: Code for my first website I've created for All City Printing Inc.
Summary: A simple website created for a small commercial printing business in San Francisco. The site is pretty straight forward
using a single page design along with a navigation bar to jump to various key points on the page. It also utilizes scroll.js to
animate the scrolling action to different parts of the page. Furthermore, it uses a Photosnack embedded slideshow to showcase 
the company's portfolio.
